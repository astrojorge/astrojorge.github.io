Hi and welcome to my page! My name is Jorge, I am a astrophyiscs PhD candidate at Arizona State University. My research focuses on charecterizing the atmopsheres of *substellar* objects, primarily exoplanets and brown dwarfs. To do this, my work involves using telescopes both on Earth and in space to study the light that comes from these astrnomical bodies. Some big questions I am looking to answer in my research are: 1) What are the compositons and climates of the amotpsheres of exoplanets and brown dwarfs 2) How do these observables change as a function of effective temperature or gravity in of these objects 3) How can we use what we learn from our current data reduction and atmopsheric modeling techniques to inform the next generation of exoplanet/brown dwarf science in the coming decade.

I recieved a BS in Astrophysics from the University of Chicago in 2021. While in undergrad, I worked as a member of several research collaborations including the [Yerkes Plates Project](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1538-3873/abec20/pdf), the [COOL-LAMPS Collaboration](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abcb86/pdf) and the [MAROON-X Team](http://www.maroonx.science/). At ASU, I work with both Jenny Patience and Mike Line stuyding the spectra from brown dwarfs and exoplanet atmospheres.

For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
